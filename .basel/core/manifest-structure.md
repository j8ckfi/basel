## Context

Understanding the role of `.basel/manifest.json` in the index.

## Answer

The manifest is generated by `basel build` and contains:

```json
{
  "version": "1.0",
  "entries": [
    {
      "id": "cli-adding-new-commands",
      "path": "cli/adding-new-commands.md",
      "question": "How do I add a new CLI command?",
      "tags": ["cli", "development"],
      "status": "closed",
      "related": []
    }
  ]
}
```

It's built from all `.md` files in `.basel/` (excluding `_` prefixed files):

```typescript
const entryPaths = await findEntries(baselDir);
const entries = await Promise.all(entryPaths.map(p => parseEntry(p)));
const manifest = await buildManifest(baselDir, entries);
await writeManifest(baselDir, manifest);
```

## Gotchas

- Run `basel build` after adding or modifying entries
- The manifest doesn't include entry content (just metadata)
- Relative paths in manifest are relative to `.basel/`
